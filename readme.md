# About Cake Image Analyzer

This is a program that computes the Entropy of an image using the `BufferedImage` class.


# Editing and compiling

To have the full support, download or clone this code and then open it as a project in [Netbeans](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

# Using

If you want to just compute your images' entropy, there is a `.rar` containing the `.jar` executable [inside dist folder](https://github.com/Jeanvit/CakeImageAnalyzer/tree/master/dist).
- To execute, double-click on Cake.jar or type `java -jar cake.jar` in the command line (inside the downloaded folder).
