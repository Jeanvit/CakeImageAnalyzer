# About Cake Image Analyzer

This is a program that computes the Entropy of an image. It is possible to either calculate the entropy of an entire image or just a part of it.
* To know more about Entropy and its usage in image processing, take a look at this [post on my blog]( http://jeanvitor.com/image-entropy-value-visualization/).


# Compiling

To have the full support, download or clone this code and then open it as a project in [Netbeans](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

# Running

If you want to just compute your images' entropy, there is a `.rar` containing the `.jar` executable [inside dist folder](https://github.com/Jeanvit/CakeImageAnalyzer/tree/master/dist).
- To execute, double-click on `Cake.jar` or type `java -jar cake.jar` in the command line

# Usage
Open an image by pressing `O`or going to `File -> Open Image` on the top menu.
* The Entropy will be shown automatically
* If a value of a specific region of the image is needed, just make a selection around it
